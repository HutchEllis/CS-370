For this project, I was tasked with automating an AI agent in a treasure hunt game. The goal was to create a Pirate non-player character (NPC) to traverse the map and successfully reach the treasure. I was provided with code containing the game environment and code that stores each episode. The code I added implements deep Q-learning to find the route the pirate should take to maximize rewards.
